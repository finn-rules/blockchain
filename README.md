# Project: Block Chain REDO

Authors: Finn Rowles

## Redo details:
Feedback receieved: Although the project compiles, it doesn't accept a positive integer as argument.
Fixed!

Regarding style errors, run `mvn checkstyle:check` to get a list of style violations. Aim for less than 3 style violations for an E. Mostly, those errors were related to missing javadoc comments, white spaces around operators and braces, and indentation.

Fixed! 0 Checkstyle violations.

Once you have this fixed, test your program with some of the examples on the website.

Fixed! Though the hashes/nonces are different, previous hashes, isValidBlockChain, removing and adding, printing balances + chain are all correct
